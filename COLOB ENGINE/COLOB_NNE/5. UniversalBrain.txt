The UniversalBrain is a class that performs mathematical operations, especially operations on custom types such as Dir2s.

You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide Dir2s using the UB. This can be handy when moving a GlobalObject around the screen/

Here is an example of adding a Dir2:

player.Position = UniversalBrain.AddDir2(player.Position, Dir2.Down());

In this case, the player's position will the result of the current position moving down one unit (Dir2.Down).

The rest of the information can be found inside the UniversalBrain class.
