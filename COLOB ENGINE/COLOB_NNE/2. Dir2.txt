A Dir2 (Direction2) is a custom data type that takes in an X value and a Y value. It can be used to define position, size, and any other data that takes in an x and a y.

An example of creating a Dir2 is:

Dir2 myDir = new Dir2(10, 5);

Now if you were to set your theoretical player's position to that new Dir2, you would do:

player.Position.X = myDir.X;
player.Position.Y = mydir.Y;


The rest of the information that will need to know about Dir2s are inside the Dir2 class within the main engine.
