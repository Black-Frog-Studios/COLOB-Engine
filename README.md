# COLOB-Engine
(disclaimer: this engine was origunally made as a joke and as such doesn't function very well)

The Class Oriented Low Object Based Engine was developed and owned by Black Frog Studios. It was developed in an effort to secure a first-party engine for the studio. Despite this, the decision was made to release it to the public for free.

The COLOB Engine supports 2D rendering, 2D textures, basic rectangle creation, simple input, and more.

The engine was intended to support only a low amount of objects per game, so it is not recommended for open world games (yet).

The engine is very easy to use as the structure of this engine is very simple and is made up of multiple components. 

To start off, you will want to read the documentation in this folder before opening up the actual engine.

The documentation can be found in the folder named "COLOB_NNE".

Also this engine is a joke, it is recommended to not utilize this graphically-superb engine for a legitimate game.
